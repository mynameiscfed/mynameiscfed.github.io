I have never heard of IRespondCon. Probably because I am not doing incident response. So why did I attend? There was a great set of talks that covered topics relevant to many industries. My two favorites were [Lenny Zeltser's](https://zeltser.com/about/) crash course on [getting started with Docker](https://zeltser.com/media/archive/docker.pdf) to run your malware analysis tools inside of containers and Rob Fry's overview of
[FIDO](http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/05/introducing-fido-automated-security.html) and how it is used at Netflix.

Overall it was a great time and I am thankful that [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com/) was grateful to host it.

There is one thing that I heard come up many times during the course of the day. It was vendors providing open API's and quality documentation to allow for cross platform integration. This is something I really agree with and think every product selction should have this as a criterion. Just my $.02.
