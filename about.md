My name is Christopher Federico. I reside in San Francisco, CA and am a product manager at [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com) focusing on web application firewall and customer log delivery.

When I am not working I cook, cure a wide variety of meats, write small bits of code, and enjoy driving the coast of California.
